# degiro_share_purchase_calculator
The purpose of this project is to create a flexible fee calculator for Degiro. This calculator can determine the maximum
number of shares a person can buy when you account for fees. This is something that personally bothers me about conducting
trades via Degiro and so I hope others may fins this project usefull.
